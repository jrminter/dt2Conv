Jython Convenience Functions for DTSA-II

Nicholas Ritchie at NIST describes [DTSA-II](http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div837/837.02/epq/dtsa2/index.html) as **a multiplatform software package for quantitative x-ray microanalysis**. He has implemented a powerful scripting language in Jython and has developed
a useful set of core functions.

As I automated my own simulations and spectrum analyses,
I discovered I was re-writing the same code multiple times.

My work flow has been influenced by many advocates of
scripted, reproducible work flows maintained under
version control. Greg Wilsom from Software Carpentry has
greatly influenced my thinking.

**dt2Conv** is my attempt to re-factor many functions from
older scripts and to collect the test data and verification
scripts into a git repository. It is a work in progress...
